    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2); // 100 100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2); // 200 100

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players; // team is just a reference to the players array

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'; // so this will update the original array: players

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'heeeee haaa';
    console.log(team4);

    // another good way to copy an array
    const team5 = Array.from(players);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    // we take a blank object {}, overwrite the property with person, then use the thrid argument to fold in our own ones.
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    // const cap3 = {...person};
    // use an object spread, that works exactly the same way as we spread into an array.
    

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const sch = {
      name: 'Steve',

      social: {
