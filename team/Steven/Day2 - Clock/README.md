# Target
Build a clock by JavaScript and CSS.
## 重點整理
1. To set the start point of transform on an element by CSS attribute `transform-origin`.
2. Using `setInterval(funciton, 1000)` with `setDate()` function to get the current time every second.

## 補充
There's a weird bounce movement when the hand goes from 354 degree to 0 degree, I choose to unset the time of transition duration to avoid it.
